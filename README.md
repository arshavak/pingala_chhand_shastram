Welcome to the `pingala_chhand_shastram` repository! This project is dedicated to the study and application of Pingala's Chhand Shastram, an ancient Sanskrit text on prosody and poetic meters.

I am a student of Sanskrit and not very skilled in coding.

Although my coding skills are limited, due to my deep understanding and interest in Sanskrit, I can be a valuable assistant for those who wish to undertake extensive work in this field. If you are working on an important project related to Sanskrit or its classical texts and need assistance from a scholarly perspective, I am prepared to offer my support based on my knowledge and experience. My goal is to promote classical Sanskrit studies and support research and development in this area.
